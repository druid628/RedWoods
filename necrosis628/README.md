## Personal

I am using this project as the base for a new Warlock Addon I'm working on. (19 May 2020)

## Base Project
-- Necrosis-LdC --
### About
Necrosis is an addon to help Warlocks manage their playstyle effectively.

The UI is composed of several distinct parts:

 * The main sphere button for important abilities (life tap, metamorphosis, drain soul, etc)
 * Menus for castable spells, curses or summoning demons
 * Buttons to create special items, summon mounts, or use certain objects (healthstone, soulstone, etc)
 * Timers for dots, cooldowns and ability procs
 * Sound notifications for important events (Shadowtrance, Backlash, etc)
 * Built-in macros to help with crowd control (Banish, Fear, Seduce) or performing rituals
 * Easy keybinding
 * nearly everything in Necrosis can be placed anywhere on your screen
 * and more features (to be added - soon!)

This revolutionary design was so popular that it was cloned to several other projects:

 * Cryolysis (1/2/3) (Mage)
 * Serenity, Orison (Priest)
 * Venantes (Hunter)
 * Totemus (Shaman)
 * HolyHope (Paladin)
