# PHP Core Files

##  Abstract

These files are just a collection of files that I can use for projects. It started as a thought experiment. 


## Why?

You're probably wondering why on earth I created something like this. That is a completely valid question. I love that
PHP gives me the fluidity of a duck type language but thanks to frameworks like Symfony pushing the boundary into more
a strongly typed language, with all the benefits of dynamically typed. I just wanted to give myself the flexibility 
and write myself objects for String, Array, and HashTable. This isn't really needed, I just wanted to try and I have 
enjoyed using them in my personal projects when I could.
